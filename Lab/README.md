## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
The function and use of a multiplexer is to choose an input that data will come from and that becomes the output. You select which input you want and that data gets passed through.

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
The function and use of a demultiplexer is to take an input and based on the selection it routes it to a specific output.

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
You can use multiplexers to build any boolean functions which is essentially what Shannon's implies. You can make any circuit you want with combinations of multiplexers.
